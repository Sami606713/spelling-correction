# Spelling Correction Project

## Project Overview
Welcome to the **Spelling Correction Project**! ðŸŽ¯ In this project, we'll build a cutting-edge spelling correction system capable of rectifying typos in sentences. By harnessing state-of-the-art transformer models, our system ensures accurate and contextually aware corrections.

## Steps to Achieve This Project

### 1. Acquire the Dataset
- **Dataset Collection**: Secure a dataset featuring both correctly spelled sentences and those with typographical errors. This will be the foundation for training our model.

  - **Dataset Link**: [Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/ml-olympiad-multilingual-spell-correction)

### 2. Select a Pre-trained Transformer Model
- **Model Selection**: Choose a robust pre-trained transformer model for fine-tuning. We will use the `T5 (Text-To-Text Transfer Transformer)` model due to its flexibility and high performance.

### 3. Fine-Tune the Model
- **Fine-Tuning**: Adapt the T5 model specifically for our spelling correction task by fine-tuning it with our dataset. This step is crucial for achieving accurate and reliable corrections.

### 4. Model Deployment and Web Interface
- **Download and Convert**: Post fine-tuning, download the model to your local machine and prepare it for web integration.

- **Create Web Interface**: Build a user-friendly web interface using `Streamlit` and `FastAPI`. Streamlit will handle the frontend, while FastAPI will manage the backend.

  - **Streamlit**: A powerful tool for building interactive web apps.
