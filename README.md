# üß© Spelling Correction Project

## üöÄ Project Overview
Welcome to the **Spelling Correction Project**! üéØ Our goal is to develop an advanced spelling correction system capable of correcting typos in sentences with precision. By utilizing state-of-the-art transformer models, we'll achieve accurate, contextually aware corrections that enhance text clarity.

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Achieve This

### 1. Acquire the Dataset
- **Dataset Collection**: Start by acquiring a dataset with both correctly spelled and typo-ridden sentences. This dataset will be crucial for training and fine-tuning our model.

  - **Dataset Link**: [Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/ml-olympiad-multilingual-spell-correction)

### 2. Select a Pre-trained Transformer Model
- **Model Selection**: Opt for a powerful pre-trained transformer model for fine-tuning. We‚Äôll use the `T5 (Text-To-Text Transfer Transformer)` model due to its flexibility and exceptional performance.

### 3. Fine-Tune the Model
- **Fine-Tuning**: Adapt the T5 model specifically for spelling correction by fine-tuning it with our dataset. This customization ensures the model performs well on our task.

### 4. Model Deployment and Web Interface
- **Download and Convert**: After fine-tuning, download the model and prepare it for integration into a web interface.

- **Create Web Interface**: Develop a user-friendly web interface using `Streamlit` and `FastAPI`. Streamlit will manage the frontend, while FastAPI will handle the backend.

  - **Streamlit**: Create interactive and visually appealing web apps effortlessly.
